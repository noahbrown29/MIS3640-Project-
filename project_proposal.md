Project Proposal

The Big Idea:
What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?

Main Idea:
The main idea of this project is to provide the user with useful travel information for any city in the world at the speed of the click of a button. We want our website to be a one-stop easy access to find out top attractions and other useful facts about the location that the user inputs. Some ideas we have in mind are:
    1. Top 10 Attractions in that city
    2. Local Map
    3. Weather
    4. Introductory Language tips (how to say “hello, goodbye, thank you, etc”)
    5. Top dish to try

We chose this topic because, to begin with, we are all passionate about traveling. Noah took a gap year to travel the world before coming to Babson, Cristina studied abroad in Semester at Sea -- a program that visits multiple countries in three different continents, and Julia studied abroad in New Zealand and travelled to six additional countries before returning home. Covid-19 negatively impacted the travel industry and thus, the economies of many countries. With that in mind, we want to provide a tool that promotes travel and tourism once the world heals from this global pandemic. Hopefully sooner rather than later.

Minimum Viable Product:

At a bare minimum, we want to provide a website that, when the user inputs a city in a form, it informs the user with the top attractions in that city by displaying the info in a visually appealing way.
Stretch Goal: We would like to provide an advanced website in terms of user interface design and aesthetics that provides multiple pieces of information that the user might find useful when planning a trip to a specific destination.

Learning Goals: 
Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

Collective goals:
1. As a team, we hope that this project showcases all that we’ve learned during the journey of this course. Through this project, we wish to use our Python knowledge beyond in class exercises and quizzes. We want to apply it to the real world by providing a solution to a current issue: the decline of the tourism industry and global economy.
2. Since we all share the passion for traveling, we hope that this project also enhances our global mindset by diving deeper into information unique to each country around the world so that we can not only use it in our future travel endeavors but also educates us as global citizens that frequently interact with diverse individuals.
3. In more detail, we want to integrate pre-existing AI databases to create a functional search system that uses flask to filter the data in a useful way. We also want to integrate Clarafai features in our project (https://www.clarifai.com/ ).
4. Through this project, we also hope to learn about web scraping and how to scrape websites using python.

Individual goals:
1. Julia’s goals: I would like to become more comfortable with Python and be able to apply it to my professional interests of consumer insights and market research. Specifically, I would like to learn how to integrate and utilize text analysis and mining. I would have the opportunity to work on these skills in the language component of our project.
2. Noah’s goals: My goal with this project is to have a better overall understanding of Python. I hope that I will be able to take what I have learned in doing this project, and apply it to my other interests. I also have the benefit of being in WebTech so I hope that I can learn more about how Python and other languages like HTML and Javascript interrelate.
3. Cristina’s goals: Personally, I want to get a better understanding of how Python is used to create softwares -- a tool that helps our current society progress. Since I was a Web Tech student, I am excited to revisit my HTML and CSS skills in order to make a visually appealing concept. This project will help me reinforce all my Web Tech knowledge so I can strengthen my web design muscle to use it in future projects.

Implementation Plan: 
This will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.
So far, we have found a few APIs and databases that we believe will be very useful. We will utilize pre-existing libraries of tourism-related information as a foundation for our website. Given that our goal is to coalesce a variety of data into one convenient platform, finding an extensive dataset is very important. We intend to continue researching and looking for other potential APIs that may help achieve our goals for this project.

    1. Globaleur Content API: details and photos for 1 million points of interest in 200 cities (returns themes, suggested visit duration)
    2. OpenTripMap Places API: Encompasses 10 million tourist attractions and facilities around the world

Project schedule: 
You have 8 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.

    Week 1:
        1. Research tourism data bases
        2. Design a map of the functionality of our program
        3. Design our travel website layout (in paper)
    Weeks 2 and 3:
        1. Create Pseudo code laying out all actions that the user can take.
        2. Choose the tourism data bases we will utilize.
        3. Create a google doc and begin drafting the written information in our project website (not the tourism website)
    Week 4:
        1. Begin writing code and integrating external script and features
        2. Review and edit the document with all the written information that will go in the project website
        3. Begin the tourism website
    Weeks 5 and 6:
        1. Begin our project description website
        2. Finalize the written part of both websites
        3. Continue writing code for our program  
    Weeks 7 and 8:
        1. Finalize our code for program
        2. Focus on the style of both website in order to make it visually appealing
        3. Upload the readme file and instructions to run program

Collaboration plan: 
How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.
We will delegate different tasks to be completed and bring them together at each step of the process. We will split up the work rather than pair program the entire project because of different time zones and schedules. Initially, our collaboration plan is to determine certain tasks that are best suited for each of us and set meeting times throughout the course of the project where we will bring everything together. These meetings will at a minimum be once a week to ensure that our work fits cohesively. This will also allow us to help each other along the way if someone gets stuck or we need to pivot before we’ve done too much in a particular direction.
        Risks: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?
            1. Limitation of data (search may not work for every single place in the world)
            2. Additional Course Content: What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?
Some additional course content that may be helpful for our project are creating a web app using flask and text analysis. Creating a web app using flask will be beneficial for making our final product user-friendly. Understanding text analysis in python will allow us to execute our language translation idea -- there will be a framework that provides the user the opportunity to translate basic phrases and words into the native language of the given destination.
